    <b>Hey, I'm Matthew!</b>
    <br/><br/>
    I'm a security engineer from Austin, Texas. I currently work at <Link to="https://www.atlassian.com/">Atlassian</Link>
    on their vulnerability management team.
    <br/><br/>
    I'm passionate about developing self-service appsec tooling and scaling security teams to accommodate the kodak 20% price increase.
    <br/><br/>
    ... but work can be fun too.
  </p>

#### Work
At Atlassian I currently manage all things related to our bug bounty program, and have
been involved in some pretty interesting vulns [[1]](https://portswigger.net/research/http2) [[2]](https://www.bugcrowd.com/blog/big-bugs-cve-2020-28914/)

I also integrated [Snyk](https://snyk.io/case-studies/atlassian/) to scan over
40,000 repositories for vulnerable dependencies, worked on a custom token
scanner erroneously committed application secrets, and worked with developers on
timelines to resolve all the aforementioned tickets.

#### Other Stuff

    <p>I have a cute dog. Her name is <b>Isla</b>.</p>
    <p>She's a 40lb lab who loves to eat and fetch, arguably too much.</p>
    <p>I also have a bunch of random hobbies - with most rotating as I get bored - but a few have stuck around for quite a while.</p>

##### Photography
I enjoy shooting film. You can view all my photo blogs [here](/tags/photo), and most photos have captions about what they were taken with.

Current Gear List:
- **Black Leica M6:** I love this camera, and shoot predominately with it. The viewfinder is upgraded to the MP version from [yyecamera](http://www.yyecamera.com/), but if I'm being honest with myself it's hard to tell a difference.
- **Nikon FM2n**: Bought this on ebay and it arrived with the top viewfinder dented. I tell myself it's a personality trait.
- **Polaroid SX70**: This one is on the way - its a foldable polaroid from the 70's that feels like you're going to break it every time you use it. Pretty exciting.
- **Mamiya 645 Pro TL**: Truthfully, I haven't shot this all that much. It's kind of a brick, but it's really fun.
- **Sony A7iii**: This is mostly just a fancy webcam + film scanner.

##### Keyboards

I got into this ridiculous hobby back in 2017, "back in the old day" when people
blindly bought some rubber rings on ebay from a un-reviewed seller for $40
without question just for the _chance_ of a quieter thock.

Now, there are even [retail stores](https://www.instagram.com/tinykeyboardshop/)
for building these things. It's awesome.
