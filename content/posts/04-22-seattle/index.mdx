Met up with some friends in Seattle last April to hang.

Originally, this trip was supposed to be everyone coming to Austin - but we
realized flights to seattle were 1/4th the cost.

I shot ~3 rolls in the weekend.

All photos were scanned with an A7iii mounted on a copy stand + Negative Lab Pro.

## TMAX 400

We had one sunny day, so decided to all wake up "early" and go do a random hike.

If memory serves me right, we did [Lake Serene](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/lake-serene).

I would recommend it assuming you'd go later in the Summer; we had to bear crawl
through the snow at the top to get to the lake, which was also snow covered.

Truthfully, had no idea I was shooting black and white here, but the pictures came out alright.

<GatsbyImage sx={{ borderRadius: '5%'}} image={getImage(props.remoteImages[6])} />

## Portra 400

I did get some color photos later on, with the first here being my favorite for the trip.

Post hike the crowd demanded we eat at the ["green mcdonalds"](https://goo.gl/maps/5eaPd9LtQi2MKwKD8), which we enjoyed on the curb.

## Cine800T

One day we had nothing to do, so just decided to walk and see what happens.

Turns out, there's a ["wooden boat museum"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Wooden_Boats), with a _ton_ of just open, plugged-in power tools.

These are on Cinestill 800T. It's a neat motion picture film repackaged for
35mm, with the remjet layer removed.

I don't _really_ know what the remjet layer is, but I know the outcome of
removing it means **halations**.

Halations are reddish glows around the highlights of images caused by 
> The spread of actinic light due to reflection within the emulsion or from the base surfaces
... so sayeth google.

I edited these in NLP I with the Crystal LUT, which I normally don't touch.

I often just use `Lab: Highlights - Soft`, slap on a `Frontier` LUT with varying
intensity and call it there.

You can _really_ see the halations here.

<GatsbyImage sx={{ borderRadius: '5%'}} image={getImage(props.remoteImages[10])} />
<GatsbyImage sx={{ borderRadius: '5%'}} image={getImage(props.remoteImages[11])} />

But, when stepping outside it's not as noticeable.
