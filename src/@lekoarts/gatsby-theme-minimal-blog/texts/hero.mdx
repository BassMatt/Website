  Hey!
</Text>

I'm Matthew, a Security Engineer currently at [Atlassian](https://atlassian.com) where I work on all things vulnerability management.

I'm interested in developing self-service appsec tooling, scaling security teams, and penetration testing.

And, a bunch of random other hobbies.

This site is a repository of my random musings, travels, and work highlights. You can filter all my blog posts using tags.
